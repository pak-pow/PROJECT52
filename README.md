## 🎯 PROJECT52 - 2026 Challenge

> **One Project. Every Week. For 52 Weeks.**

A year-long commitment to mastering Full Stack Development through deliberate, progressive practice. Starting January 2026, I'm building 52 projects that span the entire development spectrum—from foundational Python scripts to production-ready full-stack applications.

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-12)** - Master individual technologies and core concepts  
**Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 13-36)** - Connect frontend, backend, and databases into cohesive systems  
**Phase 3: Production (Weeks 37-52)** - Build scalable, deployed applications with best practices
