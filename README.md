## Overview

PROJECT52 is a structured, year-long software development initiative designed to facilitate the transition from beginner to production-ready Full Stack Developer. Starting January 2026, the roadmap mandates the creation of 52 projects, ranging from foundational scripts to deployed, scalable SaaS applications.

### Progression Philosophy

The curriculum is divided into three distinct phases, each building upon the complexity of the previous one.
